"Starter" Lasagna
1 pound sweet or hot Italian sausage (I use Johnsonville's sweet Italian sausage)
2 pounds ground sirloin
1 cup finely chopped onion
2 large cloves garlic, minced
2 TBSP sugar
1 TBSP salt
1 TBSP dried basil
1 teaspoon fennel
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 cup fresh parsley, DIVIDED
4 cups un-drained Italian plum tomatoes
2 cans (6 ounces each) tomato paste
1/2 cup water (I use red wine)
12 lasagna noodles (3/4 of one-pound package)
(1 can beef bouillon - for taste purposes - you may not use)

15 ounce container whole milk ricotta cheese (I double this)
1 egg (I double this)
1/2 teaspoon salt (I double this)
3/4 pound Mozzarella cheese, shredded (or more, if you like)
1 cup Parmesan cheese (or more, if you like)

Remove sausage meat from outer casings and chop. In 5 quart Dutch oven, over medium heat, saute sausage, beef, onion and garlic until lightly browned. Add sugar, 1 TBSP salt, basil, fennel, pepper and half the chopped parsley. Mix well. Add tomatoes, tomato paste and 1/2 cup water, mashing tomatoes with a wooded spoon. Bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer covered ; stirring occasionally, until thick, about 1 & 1/2 hours.
In 8 quart kettle, bring 3 quarts of water and 1 TBSP salt to a boil. Add lasagna noodles, 2 or 3 at a time. Return to boiling uncovered and stir occasionally, cooking 10 minutes or until tender. Drain in colander and rinse under cold water. Dry lasagna on paper towels.
In medium size bowl, combine ricotta, egg, remaining parsley and salt. Mix well. In bottom of 3 quart glass baking dish, spoon 1 & 1/2 cups meat sauce. Layer with 6 lasagna noodles lengthwise, overlapping to cover. Spread with half the ricotta mixture. Top with 1/3rd the shredded Mozzarella. Spoon 1 & 1/2 cups sauce over the cheese. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil, tucking around the edge. Bake is preheated 3560 degree oven 25 minutes. Remove foil; bake uncovered 25 minutes or until bubbly. Cool 15 minutes before serving.
Note: This take much longer than 50 minutes to cook through
